##  Trapezoid Decomposition Algorithm for Localizing a Point on a Planar Graph

Overall, the time complexity of the 
* preprocessing function is dominated by the sorting steps and is approximately **O(n log n + m log m)**.
* point_localization function is **O(log n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
